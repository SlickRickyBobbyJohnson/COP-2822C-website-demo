  <h1>Michael Dejean</h1>

  <p>Hello, my name is Michael. The pathway I took was doing a general A.A. in business and then going into the CTSD program. 
    I realized I was much more interested in software development and programming than business. 
    My goals are to finish my degree and hopefully land a job as a back-end dev. My hobbies are mostly gaming with friends when I have free time. I also like to code casually.
    I took this class because i was interested in how websites were made i've already leard alot so far i'm excited to learn more.
