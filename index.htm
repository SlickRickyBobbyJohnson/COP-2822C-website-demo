  <h1>Michael Dejean</h1>

  <p>Hello, my name is Michael. The pathway I took was doing a general A.A. in business and then going into the CTSD program. 
    I realized I was much more interested in software development and programming than business. 
    My goals are to finish my degree and hopefully land a job as a back-end dev. My hobbies are mostly gaming with friends when I have free time. I also like to code casually.
    I took this class because i was interested in how websites were made i've already leard alot so far i'm excited to learn more. 
    My favorite part about making webpages is that it's pretty similar to coding in a programming language but instead of using intellej or visual studio you can just use any basic text editor which i find very cool.
