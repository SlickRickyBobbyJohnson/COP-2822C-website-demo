  <h1>Michael Dejean</h1>

  <p>Hello, my name is Michael. I began with a general A.A. in Business, then transitioned into the B.A.S. in Computing Technology and Software Development (CTSD) program at Valencia College. Along the way, I discovered that my real passion lies in software development and programming. My goal now is to complete my degree and land a job as a back-end developer.

In my free time, I enjoy gaming with friends and casually coding for fun. I took this class because I was curious about how websites are built, and I've already learned a lot—I’m excited to dive deeper. I love working with HTML because it feels a lot like coding in a programming language, but instead of using something heavy like <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">Intellej</a> , I can just write code in any basic text editor, which I think is really cool. So far, I've taken classes in Java, CSS, and now HTML. I enjoy exploring the strengths and limitations of each and seeing how they differ.

I’ve had a great experience at Valencia. I appreciate the smaller class sizes and the school’s diverse and inclusive environment. The supportive atmosphere makes it clear that teachers genuinely want students to succeed and learn. I also like how easy they make it to transfer to a full university if you so desire with ucf direct connect.
